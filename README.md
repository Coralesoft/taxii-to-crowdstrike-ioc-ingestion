# taxii-to-crowdstrike-ioc-ingestion
A script that automates the process of polling IOCs from a STIX/TAXII server and ingesting them into CrowdStrike Falcon using the Falcon Intelligence API. It supports transforming domain names, IP addresses, and file hashes from STIX format into CrowdStrike-compatible IOCs for threat detection and response.
